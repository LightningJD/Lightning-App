## 💰 COST BREAKDOWN

### Development Phase (Months 1-3):
- **Clerk Auth:** FREE (up to 10K users)
- **Supabase:** FREE (generous limits)
- **Cloudinary:** FREE tier (25GB)
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini):** ~$5-10/month (includes testing)
- **Hosting (Vercel):** FREE
- **Domain:** $12/year
- **Total:** ~$5-10/month

### Post-Launch (1,000 active users, 500 testimonies/month):
- **Clerk:** FREE (under 10K)
- **Supabase:** FREE (likely under limits)
- **Cloudinary:** FREE (under 25GB)
- **OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini):** $0.43/month (500 testimonies @ $0.000855 each)
- **Total:** Under $5/month

### At Scale (10,000 users, 2,000 testimonies/month):
- **Clerk:** FREE (still under 10K)
- **Supabase:** $25/month (Pro plan for better performance)
- **Cloudinary:** FREE or $89/month (if exceed 25GB storage)
- **OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini):** $1.71/month (2,000 testimonies)
- **Total:** $27-116/month

### Cost per 1,000 Testimonies:
- **GPT-4o-mini:** $0.86
- **GPT-4o:** $25 (if you wanted highest quality, but unnecessary)

### At 1 Million Testimonies (Lifetime):
- **Total OpenAI cost:** $855
- That's less than hiring one writer for one testimony!

**Bottom Line:** Your app can scale to thousands of users for under $100/month! 🎉

- **Image storage costs:** Compress images, set size limits

### Product Risks:
- **Low engagement:** Focus on onboarding, notifications
- **Toxic content:** Implement moderation from day 1

- **Churn:** Build retention features (streaks, reminders)

### Business Risks:
- **No users:** Pre-launch marketing, church partnerships
- **Competition:** Differentiate with AI testimonies, authentic community
- **Monetization:** Start free, add premium tier later
- **Legal issues:** Have lawyer review terms/privacy
