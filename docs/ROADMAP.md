**REMAINING: 5-10 hours before beta launch**

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Hosting Situation (Oct 24, 2025)

**Issue**: Netlify site paused - hit 100 GB bandwidth limit with ZERO real users

**Root Cause**:
- Development builds count toward bandwidth (20+ GB)
- Frequent testing/deployments (5+ GB)
- Bot traffic (Google, security scanners: 20+ GB)
- Total usage: ~100 GB from development alone

**Solution Options**:
1. ✅ **Cloudflare Pages** (RECOMMENDED) - FREE unlimited bandwidth
   - Migration guide created: `/docs/CLOUDFLARE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Saves $228/year vs Netlify Pro
   - Scales to 100k+ users on free tier
   - Migration time: 30 minutes
   - ⚠️ **MUST DO before beta launch**

2. Netlify Pro ($19/month = $228/year)
   - Upgrade in 5 minutes
   - 1 TB bandwidth (lasts until 10k+ users)
   - Familiar platform

3. Wait for billing cycle reset
   - Free but delays launch
   - Same limits next month

**Decision**: Migrate to Cloudflare Pages (guide ready, zero code changes)

**Why Hybrid Approach:**
- ✅ Prevents catastrophic failures (monitoring, backups, rate limiting)
- ✅ Improves code maintainability (error boundaries, database modules)
- ⏳ Defers nice-to-haves (TypeScript, full testing, advanced optimization)
- 🎯 Balances speed with production-readiness

### Key Features:
1. AI-powered testimony generation (using custom framework)
2. Location-based Christian connections
3. 1-to-1 messaging
4. Group communities with co-leadership

// User language preference
const userLanguage = userProfile.language || navigator.language || 'en';

// Load appropriate translation
import translations from `./i18n/${userLanguage}.json`;

// Translation helper
const t = (key) => translations[key] || key;

// Example usage
<button>{t('send_message')}</button> // "Send Message" or "Enviar Mensagem"
```

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Add language preference to users
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferred_language VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'en';

-- Multilingual content table
CREATE TABLE content_translations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id UUID NOT NULL,
  content_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'testimony', 'message', 'group'
  language VARCHAR(5),
  translated_text TEXT,
  original_language VARCHAR(5),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Auto-Translation Feature:**
```javascript
// On testimony view
const translateTestimony = async (testimony, targetLanguage) => {
  // Check cache first
  const cached = await getCachedTranslation(testimony.id, targetLanguage);
  if (cached) return cached;

  // Translate via API
  const translated = await googleTranslate(testimony.text, targetLanguage);

  // Cache for future
  await cacheTranslation(testimony.id, targetLanguage, translated);

  return translated;
};
```

## 🎯 CONVERSION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Testimony-First Conversion (PRIORITY - Highest ROI)

**Concept:** Allow anyone to create a testimony BEFORE signing up, then prompt them to save/publish it.

**Why This Works:**
1. **Psychological Commitment (Sunk Cost Fallacy):**
   - User spends 5-10 minutes answering 4 questions
   - User watches AI generate their personal story
   - User reads their completed testimony (emotional connection)
   - Loss aversion: "I don't want to lose this beautiful testimony I just created"
   - Estimated conversion: **65-80%** (highest of all strategies)

2. **Experience-First, Gate-Later:**
   - User experiences core value BEFORE friction
   - Proves the product works (builds trust)
   - Removes "what if it's not good?" doubt
   - Similar to: Canva (design first, signup to save), Grammarly (edit first, signup for premium)

3. **Intent Signal:**
   - Only serious users create testimonies
   - Filters out casual browsers
   - Higher quality signups (engaged users)
   - These users more likely to be active long-term

4. **Emotional Connection:**
   - Testimonies are deeply personal
   - Users feel vulnerable sharing their story
   - Creates stronger bond with the app
   - "This app helped me articulate my faith journey"

**Implementation:**
```
1. Guest clicks "Share Your Testimony" → No signup required
2. Guest answers 4 questions (full experience)
3. AI generates testimony (show full generated text)
4. Modal appears: "✨ Save Your Testimony"
   - "Your story is ready! Create a free account to:"
   - ✓ Publish your testimony
   - ✓ Share with the community
   - ✓ Connect with believers who relate
   - ✓ Keep your story forever
   - [Sign Up with Google] (primary)
   - [Continue Without Saving] (secondary - shown in small text)
5. If user signs up → Testimony auto-saves to their profile
6. If user dismisses → Store testimony in localStorage
   - Next visit: "Welcome back! Your testimony is waiting. Sign up to publish it."
   - 7-day retention: Remind user via browser notification (if granted)
```

**Edge Cases:**
- User refreshes during generation → Save answers in localStorage
- User closes modal without signing up → Store testimony, show reminder on next visit
- User signs up later → Migrate saved testimony to their account

**Expected Conversion Rate:** 65-80% (compared to 35-45% for passive browsing limits)

---

### Strategy 2: Freemium Browse & Block (IMPLEMENTED - Infrastructure Ready)

**Concept:** Let guests browse 2 testimonies, scroll 3 users, then require signup.

**Why This Works:**
1. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):**
   - "I want to read the rest of that testimony..."
   - "I saw someone interesting, but now I can't message them"
   - Creates urgency without being pushy

2. **Social Proof:**
   - Guest sees real testimonies from real people
   - "Wow, these stories are powerful"
   - Validates the community quality

3. **Hybrid Approach (Instagram + Reddit):**
   - Aggressive enough to convert (35-45%)
   - Lenient enough to not frustrate users
   - 2 testimonies = 5-6 minutes of content (enough to decide)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Infrastructure 100% complete (guestSession.js, SignupModal.jsx, useGuestModal.js, GuestModalContext.jsx)
- ⏳ Tracking integration pending (30-60 mins)
- 📊 See `/docs/FREEMIUM_AUTH_STRATEGY.md` for full analysis
- 📋 See `/docs/FREEMIUM_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for integration guide

**Expected Conversion Rate:** 35-45%

---

### Strategy 3: Social Proof & Testimonials (Quick Win)

**Concept:** Show signup stats and recent activity to build trust.

**Implementation Ideas:**
1. **Live Counter on Landing/Profile:**
   - "Join 1,247 believers sharing their stories"
   - Updates in real-time (motivates joining a movement)

2. **Recent Testimonies Feed (Public Preview):**
   - Show 3 recent testimonies on landing page
   - "See what others are sharing..."
   - Truncated with "Sign up to read more"

3. **Social Proof Badges:**
   - "Sarah, John, and 12 others from your area are on Lightning"
   - "15 new testimonies shared this week"
   - "328 believers connected this month"

4. **Trust Indicators:**
   - "🔒 Your story is private until you choose to share"
   - "⚡ AI-powered, human-approved"
   - "🙏 Built by believers, for believers"

**Expected Conversion Lift:** +10-15% (additive to other strategies)

---

### Strategy 4: Scarcity & Exclusivity (Growth Hack)

**Concept:** Create artificial scarcity to increase demand.

**Implementation Ideas:**
1. **Beta Waitlist (Launch Phase):**
   - "Lightning is currently invite-only"
   - "Join 500 people on the waitlist"
   - Request email → Send invite code in 2-3 days
   - Psychology: "If it's exclusive, it must be valuable"

2. **Invite System:**
   - Each user gets 5 invite codes
   - "Invite friends to skip the waitlist"
   - Creates viral loop (users recruit users)
   - Similar to: Gmail (invite-only initially), Clubhouse, OnlyFans

3. **Limited-Time Features:**
   - "Sign up this week to get early access to Groups"
   - "First 1,000 users get a Founder badge"
   - Urgency + exclusivity = higher conversion

**Expected Conversion Lift:** +20-30% (during launch phase)

---

### Strategy 5: Progressive Profiling (Reduce Friction)

**Concept:** Minimize signup friction, collect data gradually.

**Implementation:**
1. **One-Click Signup:**
   - "Continue with Google" (no email/password)
   - Auto-generate username (let them change later)
   - NO multi-step forms initially

2. **Post-Signup Gradual Data Collection:**
   - Step 1 (immediate): Just sign in
   - Step 2 (after 1 min): "Add your name and location" (optional)
   - Step 3 (after viewing 3 profiles): "Upload a profile picture to connect with others"
   - Step 4 (after 1 day): "Share your testimony to complete your profile"

3. **Profile Completeness Bar:**
   - "Your profile is 60% complete"
   - Shows missing items: Testimony (40%), Bio (10%), Picture (20%), Location (10%)
   - Gamification: Users want to hit 100%

**Expected Conversion Lift:** +25-35% (reduces signup abandonment)

---

### Strategy 6: Personalized Onboarding (Retention Tool)

**Concept:** Tailor experience based on user intent.

**Implementation:**
1. **First-Time User Flow:**
   - "What brings you to Lightning?" (multi-choice)
     - [ ] I want to share my testimony
     - [ ] I want to read others' stories
     - [ ] I'm looking for Christian friends nearby
     - [ ] I want to join a faith-based group

2. **Intent-Based Routing:**
   - Selected "Share testimony" → Direct to testimony generator
   - Selected "Read stories" → Show curated testimonies feed
   - Selected "Find friends" → Show Connect tab with nearby users
   - Selected "Join group" → Show popular groups

3. **Quick Wins:**
   - "Complete these 3 actions to get started:"
   - ✓ Add your testimony (40% complete)
   - ✓ Connect with 3 believers (0% complete)
   - ✓ Join your first group (0% complete)
   - Progress bar motivates completion

**Expected Retention Lift:** +30-40% (keeps users engaged past Day 1)

---

### Strategy 7: Email Re-engagement (Recovery Tool)

**Concept:** Win back users who signed up but didn't complete profile.

**Implementation:**
1. **Drip Campaign for Incomplete Profiles:**
   - Day 1: "Welcome to Lightning! Complete your profile to start connecting."
   - Day 3: "You're missing out! 47 new believers joined this week."
   - Day 7: "Your testimony is waiting. Share your story in 5 minutes."
   - Day 14: "Last chance: Your Lightning account will expire soon."

2. **Behavioral Triggers:**
   - User viewed 2 testimonies but didn't create one → "Ready to share your story?"
   - User added 3 friends but no messages → "Say hi to your new connections!"
   - User joined group but silent → "Introduce yourself in [Group Name]!"

3. **Win-Back Incentives:**
   - "Come back and get featured in this week's spotlight"
   - "Your friends are wondering where you went"
   - "Someone liked your testimony!"

**Expected Recovery Rate:** 15-25% of inactive users

---

### Strategy 8: Referral Program (Viral Growth)

**Concept:** Turn users into recruiters with incentives.

**Implementation:**
1. **Invite & Earn:**
   - "Invite 3 friends, unlock Premium features for free"
   - Each referral = 1 month free premium
   - Track via unique referral codes

2. **Friend Finder:**
   - "Find friends from your contacts"
   - Import contacts (with permission)
   - "5 of your contacts are already on Lightning!"

3. **Social Sharing:**
   - "Share your testimony on Facebook/Twitter"
   - Auto-generate beautiful social cards
   - Include "Created with Lightning ⚡" watermark
   - Links back to signup page

**Expected Growth Rate:** 1.3x viral coefficient (each user brings 0.3 more users)

---

### Strategy 9: Exit-Intent Popup (Last Chance)

**Concept:** Catch users before they leave.

**Implementation:**
1. **Mouse Leaves Browser Window:**
   - Show modal: "Before you go..."
   - "Join 1,200 believers sharing their faith journey"
   - [Sign Up in 10 Seconds] button
   - Discount/incentive: "Get featured in this week's newsletter"

2. **Session Timeout (After 5 Minutes Inactive):**
   - "Still there? Save your progress by creating a free account."
   - Prevents data loss (esp. for testimony drafts)

**Expected Conversion Lift:** +5-10% (low effort, decent ROI)

---

### Strategy 10: Notifications & Push (Re-engagement)

**Concept:** Bring users back with timely notifications.

**Implementation:**
1. **Browser Push Notifications:**
   - "John liked your testimony!"
   - "Sarah wants to connect with you"
   - "Your friend just shared their story"
   - Re-engagement: Brings users back daily

2. **In-App Notification Badge:**
   - Red badge on Messages/Connect tabs
   - FOMO: "I need to check what I'm missing"

3. **Email Digests:**
   - Weekly: "5 new testimonies from your area"
   - Monthly: "You inspired 12 people this month"

**Expected Re-engagement Rate:** 40-50% of users return within 7 days

---

  - Only serious users create testimonies (filters quality)
  - Deeply personal stories create emotional connection
  - Similar to industry-leading products (Canva, Grammarly, Figma)
- **🎓 Why This Matters:**
  - Current approach: Auth → Profile → Testimony (multi-step friction)
  - New approach: Testimony → Auth → Auto-save (single decision point)
  - Users get instant value, then choose to keep it
  - Dramatically reduces signup abandonment

**October 23, 2025 (Evening)** - Real-Time Messaging Backend COMPLETE ✅

---

**🎉 YOU'RE READY TO BUILD!**

This plan will guide you from where you are now (70% frontend, 0% backend) to a fully launched app with real users.

**Estimated Timeline:**
- 6 weeks to MVP beta
- 10 weeks to public launch
- 13+ weeks for full feature set

**Stick to the plan, don't skip steps, and you'll have a successful launch! 🚀**

---

### PHASE 1.5: CODE ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS (Parallel with Weeks 4-6)

**Purpose:** Refactor codebase for scalability, maintainability, and production-readiness
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks (can run parallel to MVP polish)
**Philosophy:** SOLID principles, modular design, <500 lines per file

**Modules:**
1. **Database Layer Refactoring** (Week 1) - Break monolithic database.js into SOLID modules
2. **TypeScript Migration** (Week 2) - Add type safety and IDE support
3. **Testing Infrastructure** (Week 3) - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Error Boundaries** (Week 4, Days 1-3) - Graceful failure handling
5. **Testimony Formatting Helper** (Week 4, Days 4-5) - OPTIONAL: Basic grammar/punctuation fixes only
6. **Caching & Performance** (Week 4, Days 4-7) - React Query for intelligent caching

**Note on Testimony Integrity:**
AI content generation for testimonies was explicitly rejected to preserve testimony authenticity. Users' exact words and experiences must never be altered, embellished, or interpreted. The optional formatting helper only fixes basic grammar/punctuation while preserving 100% of original content.

---

#### Module 1: Database Layer Refactoring (Week 1)

**Current State:**
- `src/lib/database.js`: 1177 lines (TOO LARGE)
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Difficult to test, maintain, and extend

**Target Architecture (SOLID Principles):**

- ✅ Ready for TypeScript migration

---

#### Module 2: TypeScript Migration (Week 2)

**Current State:**
- All files are `.js` or `.jsx`
- No type safety
- IDE autocomplete limited

**Target:**
- Incremental migration to TypeScript
- Start with new files, gradually migrate existing
- Full type coverage for database layer

**Benefits:**
1. **Catch bugs at compile-time** (not runtime)
2. **Better IDE support** (autocomplete, refactoring)
3. **Self-documenting code** (types as inline docs)
4. **Safer refactoring** (compiler catches breaking changes)
5. **Third-party types** (Supabase has official TypeScript support)

**Implementation Plan:**

**Days 1-2: Setup TypeScript Infrastructure**
- [ ] Install TypeScript: `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom`
- [ ] Create `tsconfig.json` with strict mode
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "ES2020",
      "module": "ESNext",
      "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"],
      "jsx": "react-jsx",
      "strict": true,
      "moduleResolution": "bundler",
      "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "noEmit": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "allowJs": true,
      "checkJs": false,
      "incremental": true
    },
    "include": ["src"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Install Supabase types: `npm install --save-dev @supabase/supabase-js`
- [ ] Generate database types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <project-id> > src/lib/database/base/database.types.ts`
- [ ] Add type-check script to package.json: `"type-check": "tsc --noEmit"`
- [ ] Verify Vite supports TypeScript (built-in support)

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - TS SETUP (20 min):**
- [ ] ✅ `npm run type-check` runs without errors
- [ ] ✅ Vite dev server starts with TS files
- [ ] ✅ Create test file `src/test.ts` with typed code → compiles
- [ ] ✅ Database types generated correctly
- [ ] ✅ No breaking changes to existing JS files
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of successful type-check
- [ ] ⚠️ Setup must work before migration

**Days 3-4: Migrate Database Layer to TypeScript**
- [ ] Rename files in order:
  1. `base/types.js` → `base/types.ts`
  2. `base/errors.js` → `base/errors.ts`
  3. `base/client.js` → `base/client.ts`
  4. `repositories/users.repository.js` → `repositories/users.repository.ts`
  5. `repositories/testimonies.repository.js` → `repositories/testimonies.repository.ts`
  6. Continue for all repository files...
- [ ] Add TypeScript types to all functions
  ```typescript
  // Before (JS)
  export const getUserProfile = async (userId) => { ... }

  // After (TS)
  export const getUserProfile = async (userId: string): Promise<User | null> => { ... }
  ```
- [ ] Use generated Supabase types for database queries
  ```typescript
  import { Database } from './base/database.types';
  type User = Database['public']['Tables']['users']['Row'];
  ```
- [ ] Add proper error typing
  ```typescript
  import { DatabaseError } from './base/errors';

  export const createUser = async (data: UserInsert): Promise<User> => {
    const { data: user, error } = await supabase.from('users').insert(data);
    if (error) throw new DatabaseError(error.message, error);
    return user;
  };
  ```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - DATABASE TS (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ `npm run type-check` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] ✅ All database functions have type signatures
- [ ] ✅ IDE autocomplete works for database queries
- [ ] ✅ Try passing wrong type to function → TypeScript error shows
- [ ] ✅ App still runs in dev mode
- [ ] ✅ Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] 🧪 Test type safety: `getUserProfile(123)` (number instead of string) → type error
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of IDE autocomplete
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of type error in IDE
- [ ] ⚠️ Must have 0 type errors before proceeding

**Days 5-6: Migrate React Components to TypeScript**
- [ ] Rename component files `.jsx` → `.tsx` in order:
  1. Simple components first: `UserCard.jsx` → `UserCard.tsx`
  2. Context providers: `GuestModalContext.jsx` → `GuestModalContext.tsx`
  3. Custom hooks: `useUserProfile.js` → `useUserProfile.ts`
  4. Complex components: `ProfileTab.jsx` → `ProfileTab.tsx`
  5. Main app: `App.jsx` → `App.tsx`
- [ ] Add React prop types
  ```typescript
  // Before
  const UserCard = ({ user, onClick }) => { ... }

  // After
  interface UserCardProps {
    user: User;
    onClick: (userId: string) => void;
  }

  const UserCard: React.FC<UserCardProps> = ({ user, onClick }) => { ... }
  ```
- [ ] Add state typing
  ```typescript
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  ```
- [ ] Type event handlers
  ```typescript
  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => { ... }
  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => { ... }
  ```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - COMPONENTS TS (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] ✅ All components render correctly
- [ ] ✅ No TypeScript errors in IDE
- [ ] ✅ Props are typed (IDE shows autocomplete)
- [ ] ✅ Event handlers typed correctly
- [ ] ✅ Build succeeds
- [ ] 🧪 Try passing wrong prop type → type error
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of component prop autocomplete
- [ ] ⚠️ Components must work identically to before

**Day 7: Type Coverage & Documentation**
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments with TypeScript types to all public functions
  ```typescript
  /**

#### Module 3: Testing Infrastructure (Week 3)

**Current State:**
- No test files
- No testing framework
- Manual testing only

**Target:**
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- CI/CD integration ready

**Testing Stack:**
- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing (Vite-native)
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
- **Playwright** - E2E testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - API mocking

**Implementation Plan:**

**Days 1-2: Setup Testing Infrastructure**
- [ ] Install testing libraries:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/ui jsdom
  npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
  npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
  npm install --save-dev msw
  ```
- [ ] Create `vitest.config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    test: {
      globals: true,
      environment: 'jsdom',
      setupFiles: ['./src/tests/setup.ts'],
      coverage: {
        provider: 'v8',
        reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
        exclude: ['node_modules/', 'src/tests/'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
- [ ] Create test setup file: `src/tests/setup.ts`
  ```typescript
  import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
  import { beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll } from 'vitest';
  import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react';
  import { server } from './mocks/server';

  beforeAll(() => server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'error' }));
  afterEach(() => {
    cleanup();
    server.resetHandlers();
  });
  afterAll(() => server.close());
  ```
- [ ] Setup MSW for API mocking: `src/tests/mocks/handlers.ts`
  ```typescript
  import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw';

  export const handlers = [
    http.post('/api/generate-testimony', () => {
      return HttpResponse.json({
        testimony: 'Test testimony content...',
        success: true,
      });
    }),
  ];
  ```
- [ ] Add test scripts to package.json:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "vitest",
      "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
      "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
      "test:e2e": "playwright test"
    }
  }
  ```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - TEST SETUP (20 min):**

  ```
  src/lib/database/
    repositories/
      users.repository.ts
      users.repository.test.ts      # <-- Test file
      testimonies.repository.ts
      testimonies.repository.test.ts
      ...
  ```
- [ ] Write tests for `users.repository.ts`:
  ```typescript
  // users.repository.test.ts
  import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
  import { getUserProfile, updateUserProfile } from './users.repository';
  import { mockSupabaseClient } from '../../tests/mocks/supabase';

  describe('users.repository', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      mockSupabaseClient.reset();
    });

    describe('getUserProfile', () => {
      it('should fetch user profile successfully', async () => {
        const mockUser = { id: '123', username: 'testuser' };
        mockSupabaseClient.mockResponse(mockUser);

        const result = await getUserProfile('123');

        expect(result).toEqual(mockUser);
      });

      it('should return null if user not found', async () => {
        mockSupabaseClient.mockError({ code: 'PGRST116' });

        const result = await getUserProfile('nonexistent');

        expect(result).toBeNull();
      });

      it('should throw DatabaseError on query failure', async () => {
        mockSupabaseClient.mockError({ message: 'Connection failed' });

        await expect(getUserProfile('123')).rejects.toThrow('Connection failed');
      });
    });
  });
  ```
- [ ] Write tests for all repositories:
  - User operations (sync, fetch, update, location)
  - Testimony operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Friendship operations (send, accept, decline)
  - Message operations (send, fetch, mark read)
  - Group operations (create, join, leave)
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - Empty results
  - Network failures
  - Invalid inputs
  - Race conditions
- [ ] Aim for >90% coverage on database layer

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - UNIT TESTS (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ `npm run test` passes all tests
- [ ] ✅ `npm run test:coverage` shows >90% coverage for database layer
- [ ] ✅ All edge cases tested

  describe('UserCard', () => {
    const mockUser = {
      id: '123',
      username: 'testuser',
      display_name: 'Test User',
      avatar_emoji: '👤',
      is_online: true,
    };

    it('should render user information', () => {
      render(<UserCard user={mockUser} onClick={() => {}} />);

      expect(screen.getByText('Test User')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('@testuser')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('👤')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    it('should show online indicator when user is online', () => {
      render(<UserCard user={mockUser} onClick={() => {}} />);

      const onlineIndicator = screen.getByTestId('online-indicator');
      expect(onlineIndicator).toHaveClass('bg-green-400');
    });

    it('should call onClick when clicked', () => {
      const handleClick = vi.fn();
      render(<UserCard user={mockUser} onClick={handleClick} />);

      fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));

      expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledWith('123');
    });
  });
  ```
- [ ] Test critical components:
  - ProfileTab (profile display, edit mode)
  - MessagesTab (conversation list, message display)
  - GroupsTab (group list, create group)
  - NearbyTab (user discovery, sorting)
  - AuthWrapper (Clerk integration)
  - ProfileCreationWizard (multi-step form)
- [ ] Test user interactions:
  - Form submissions
  - Button clicks

- [ ] Create E2E test file: `tests/e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`
  ```typescript
  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

  test.describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
    test('should allow user to sign up and create profile', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');

      // Click sign up
      await page.click('text=Join Lightning');

      // Fill in Google OAuth (mocked in test environment)
      await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
      await page.click('text=Continue with Google');

      // Should redirect to profile creation
      await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*profile/);

      // Fill profile form
      await page.fill('input[name="displayName"]', 'Test User');
      await page.fill('textarea[name="bio"]', 'Test bio');
      await page.click('button:has-text("Save Profile")');

      // Should see profile tab
      await expect(page.locator('text=Test User')).toBeVisible();

#### Module 4: Error Boundaries & Resilience (Week 4, Days 1-3)

**Current State:**
- No error boundaries
- One error crashes entire app
- Poor error UX

**Target:**
- Graceful error handling
- Isolated failures
- User-friendly error messages

**Implementation Plan:**

**Day 1: Error Boundary Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create error boundary components:
  ```typescript
  // src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  import React, { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react';

  interface Props {
    children: ReactNode;
    fallback?: ReactNode;
    onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void;
  }

  interface State {
    hasError: boolean;
    error: Error | null;
  }

  class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
    constructor(props: Props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { hasError: false, error: null };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
      return { hasError: true, error };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
      console.error('ErrorBoundary caught:', error, errorInfo);
      this.props.onError?.(error, errorInfo);

      // Send to error tracking service (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
      // logErrorToService(error, errorInfo);
    }

    render() {
      if (this.state.hasError) {
        return this.props.fallback || (
          <div className="error-fallback">
            <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
            <button onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false, error: null })}>
              Try again
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }

      return this.props.children;
    }
  }

  export default ErrorBoundary;
  ```
- [ ] Create specialized error UI components:
  ```typescript
  // src/components/errors/ErrorFallback.tsx
  export const ErrorFallback: React.FC<{ error: Error; resetError: () => void }> = ({ error, resetError }) => (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-100">
      <div className="bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-lg rounded-2xl p-8 shadow-xl max-w-md">
        <div className="text-6xl mb-4">⚠️</div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Oops! Something went wrong</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">We're sorry for the inconvenience. Please try again.</p>
        <button onClick={resetError} className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-indigo-600 text-white py-3 rounded-lg">
          Try Again
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
  ```
- [ ] Create feature-specific error boundaries:
  ```typescript
  // src/components/errors/MessageErrorBoundary.tsx
  export const MessageErrorBoundary: React.FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => (
    <ErrorBoundary
      fallback={
        <div className="p-4 bg-red-50 rounded-lg">
          <p>Failed to load messages. Please refresh.</p>
        </div>
      }
    >
      {children}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
  ```

**Day 2: Implement Error Boundaries Throughout App**
- [ ] Wrap entire app in root error boundary:
  ```typescript
  // App.tsx
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
    <ClerkProvider>
      <AuthWrapper>
        {/* App content */}
      </AuthWrapper>
    </ClerkProvider>
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```
- [ ] Wrap each tab in feature error boundary:
  ```typescript
  // App.tsx
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<TabErrorFallback tabName="Messages" />}>
    <MessagesTab />
  </ErrorBoundary>

  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<TabErrorFallback tabName="Groups" />}>
    <GroupsTab />
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```
- [ ] Wrap critical components:
  ```typescript
  // ProfileTab.tsx
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Failed to load profile</p>}>
    <TestimonyDisplay testimony={testimony} />
  </ErrorBoundary>

  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Failed to load music player</p>}>
    <MusicPlayer url={musicUrl} />
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```

**Day 3: Error Tracking & Monitoring**
- [ ] Integrate error tracking service (choose one):
  - **Option A: Sentry** (recommended, free tier)
    ```bash
    npm install @sentry/react
    ```
    ```typescript
    // main.tsx
    import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

    Sentry.init({
      dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
      environment: import.meta.env.MODE,
      tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    });
    ```
  - **Option B: LogRocket** (session replay)
  - **Option C: Custom logging** (to Supabase)
- [ ] Add error context to all boundaries:
  ```typescript
  <ErrorBoundary
    onError={(error, errorInfo) => {
      Sentry.captureException(error, {
        contexts: {
          react: {
            componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,
          },
        },
      });
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```
- [ ] Create error notification system:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/errors/notifier.ts
  import toast from 'react-hot-toast';

  export const notifyError = (error: Error, context?: string) => {
    console.error(`Error in ${context}:`, error);
    toast.error(error.message || 'Something went wrong. Please try again.');
  };
  ```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - ERROR BOUNDARIES (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Simulate error in ProfileTab → only Profile breaks, app still works
- [ ] ✅ Simulate error in MessagesTab → Messages shows error, other tabs work
- [ ] ✅ Click "Try Again" → component recovers
- [ ] ✅ Simulate network error → user-friendly message shows
- [ ] ✅ Error logged to tracking service (check Sentry dashboard)
- [ ] 🧪 Test each tab with simulated errors
- [ ] 🧪 Test nested component errors
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of error fallback UI
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of Sentry dashboard (if using)
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: App must stay functional when parts fail
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Error boundaries at app, tab, and component levels
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ App stays functional when features fail
- ✅ Errors logged to tracking service
- ✅ "Try Again" functionality works

#### Module 5: Testimony Formatting Helper (Week 4, Days 4-5) - OPTIONAL

**Current State:**
- Client-side template concatenates user answers
- No grammar/spelling correction
- No formatting assistance

**Target:**
- Basic grammar and spelling correction ONLY
- Proper capitalization and punctuation
- Paragraph formatting
- **CRITICAL: Zero content additions or embellishments**

**Ethical Boundary:**
This module is OPTIONAL and only performs basic text cleanup. It does NOT:
- ❌ Add new details or events
- ❌ Interpret or embellish experiences
- ❌ Change meaning or tone
- ❌ Add emotional language user didn't write
- ✅ ONLY fixes spelling, grammar, capitalization, punctuation

**Rationale:**
AI content generation was rejected due to testimony integrity concerns. Users' exact words must be preserved. This optional helper only cleans up basic formatting/grammar errors while maintaining 100% of the original content.

**Implementation:**

**Day 4: Create Basic Formatting Service**
- [ ] Create utility service:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/services/testimony-formatter.service.ts

  /**
   * Formats user testimony with basic grammar/spelling fixes ONLY
   * DOES NOT add content, embellish, or interpret
   */
  export const formatTestimony = (answers: string[]): string => {
    // Basic formatting only
    const formatted = answers.map(answer => {
      // Fix common typos and capitalization
      let text = answer.trim();

      // Capitalize first letter
      text = text.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + text.slice(1);

      // Ensure proper punctuation at end
      if (!/[.!?]$/.test(text)) {
        text += '.';
      }

      // Fix "i" → "I"
      text = text.replace(/\bi\b/g, 'I');

      // Fix "god" → "God", "jesus" → "Jesus" (proper nouns)
      text = text.replace(/\bgod\b/gi, 'God');
      text = text.replace(/\bjesus\b/gi, 'Jesus');
      text = text.replace(/\bchrist\b/gi, 'Christ');

      return text;
    });

    // Join with paragraph breaks
    return formatted.join('\n\n');
  };
  ```
- [ ] Add toggle in UI (user chooses basic formatting or raw text)
- [ ] Default: Use formatting helper
- [ ] Option: "Use my exact text" checkbox

**Day 5: Testing & User Control**
- [ ] Test with various inputs (typos, missing punctuation, lowercase)
- [ ] Verify zero content additions
- [ ] Add preview showing before/after
- [ ] User can accept or reject formatted version

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - FORMATTING (30 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Capitalization fixed (i → I, god → God)
- [ ] ✅ Punctuation added at end of sentences
- [ ] ✅ Paragraph breaks added between answers
- [ ] ✅ **CRITICAL:** No new words or phrases added
- [ ] ✅ User can toggle formatting on/off
- [ ] ✅ Original text always preserved in database
- [ ] 🧪 Test with intentional misspellings
- [ ] 🧪 Test with all lowercase input
- [ ] 🧪 Test with missing punctuation
- [ ] 🧪 Verify output contains ONLY user's words
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of before/after preview
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must preserve testimony integrity
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Add optional basic formatting helper for testimonies"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Basic grammar/spelling corrections only
- ✅ Zero content additions
- ✅ User has full control (can disable)
- ✅ Maintains testimony authenticity
- ✅ Optional feature (not required)

---

#### Module 6: Caching & Performance Optimization (Week 4, Days 4-7, parallel with Module 5)

**Current State:**
- No caching layer
- Redundant database queries
- Potential performance issues at scale

**Target:**
- Intelligent caching strategy
- Reduced database load
- Faster page loads
- Better UX (instant navigation)

**Implementation Plan:**

**Day 4: Setup TanStack Query (React Query)**
- [ ] Install React Query:
  ```bash
  npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
  ```
- [ ] Setup QueryClient:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/query/client.ts
  import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

  export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
        retry: 1,
        refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      },
    },
  });
  ```
- [ ] Wrap app in QueryClientProvider:
  ```typescript
  // App.tsx
  import { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
  import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';
  import { queryClient } from './lib/query/client';

  function App() {
    return (
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <ErrorBoundary>
          {/* App content */}
        </ErrorBoundary>
        <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

**Day 5: Implement Query Hooks for Database Operations**
- [ ] Create query hooks for users:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/query/hooks/useUserProfile.ts
  import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
  import { getUserProfile } from '../../database/repositories/users.repository';

  export const useUserProfile = (userId: string) => {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['user', userId],
      queryFn: () => getUserProfile(userId),
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 5 minutes
      enabled: !!userId,
    });
  };

  // Usage in component:
  // const { data: profile, isLoading, error } = useUserProfile(userId);
  ```
- [ ] Create query hooks for other data:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/query/hooks/useTestimony.ts
  export const useTestimony = (userId: string) => {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['testimony', userId],
      queryFn: () => getTestimony(userId),
      staleTime: 60 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 1 hour (testimonies change rarely)
    });
  };

  // src/lib/query/hooks/useConversations.ts
  export const useConversations = (userId: string) => {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['conversations', userId],
      queryFn: () => getUserConversations(userId),
      staleTime: 30 * 1000, // Cache for 30 seconds (fresher for messages)
    });
  };

  // src/lib/query/hooks/useNearbyUsers.ts
  export const useNearbyUsers = (lat: number, lng: number, radius: number) => {
    return useQuery({
      queryKey: ['nearbyUsers', lat, lng, radius],
      queryFn: () => findNearbyUsers(lat, lng, radius),
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 5 minutes
    });
  };
  ```
- [ ] Create mutation hooks for updates:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/query/hooks/useUpdateProfile.ts
  import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
  import { updateUserProfile } from '../../database/repositories/users.repository';

  export const useUpdateProfile = () => {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    return useMutation({
      mutationFn: (data: UserUpdate) => updateUserProfile(data),
      onSuccess: (updatedUser) => {
        // Invalidate and refetch user profile
        queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['user', updatedUser.id] });
        toast.success('Profile updated!');
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        toast.error('Failed to update profile');
      },
    });
  };

  // Usage:
  // const { mutate: updateProfile, isLoading } = useUpdateProfile();
  // updateProfile({ id: userId, bio: 'New bio' });
  ```

**Day 6: Integrate Caching in Components**
- [ ] Update ProfileTab to use caching:
  ```typescript
  // src/components/ProfileTab.tsx (before)
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadProfile = async () => {
      const data = await getUserProfile(userId);
      setProfile(data);
    };
    loadProfile();
  }, [userId]);

  // src/components/ProfileTab.tsx (after)
  import { useUserProfile } from '../lib/query/hooks/useUserProfile';
  import { useTestimony } from '../lib/query/hooks/useTestimony';

  const { data: profile, isLoading: profileLoading } = useUserProfile(userId);
  const { data: testimony, isLoading: testimonyLoading } = useTestimony(userId);

  if (profileLoading || testimonyLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  ```
- [ ] Update MessagesTab:
  ```typescript
  // MessagesTab.tsx
  import { useConversations } from '../lib/query/hooks/useConversations';

  const { data: conversations, isLoading } = useConversations(currentUserId);
  ```
- [ ] Update NearbyTab:
  ```typescript
  // NearbyTab.tsx
  import { useNearbyUsers } from '../lib/query/hooks/useNearbyUsers';

  const { data: nearbyUsers, isLoading } = useNearbyUsers(lat, lng, radius);
  ```

**Day 7: Real-time Cache Invalidation**
- [ ] Invalidate cache on real-time updates:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/realtime/messageSubscriber.ts
  import { queryClient } from '../query/client';

  export const subscribeToMessages = (userId: string, callback: (message: Message) => void) => {
    const channel = supabase
      .channel('messages')
      .on('postgres_changes',
        { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'messages', filter: `recipient_id=eq.${userId}` },
        (payload) => {
          callback(payload.new as Message);

          // Invalidate conversations cache
          queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['conversations', userId] });
        }
      )
      .subscribe();

    return () => {
      channel.unsubscribe();
    };
  };
  ```
- [ ] Optimistic updates for instant UX:
  ```typescript
  // src/lib/query/hooks/useSendMessage.ts
  export const useSendMessage = () => {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    return useMutation({
      mutationFn: (message: MessageInsert) => sendMessage(message),
      onMutate: async (newMessage) => {
        // Cancel outgoing refetches
        await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['conversations'] });

        // Snapshot previous value
        const previousConversations = queryClient.getQueryData(['conversations']);

        // Optimistically update cache
        queryClient.setQueryData(['conversations', newMessage.sender_id], (old: any) => {
          return [newMessage, ...old];
        });

        return { previousConversations };
      },
      onError: (err, newMessage, context) => {
        // Rollback on error
        queryClient.setQueryData(['conversations'], context?.previousConversations);
      },
      onSettled: () => {
        // Refetch after mutation
        queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['conversations'] });
      },
    });
  };
  ```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - CACHING (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Open DevTools → React Query tab appears
- [ ] ✅ Load profile → query cached (see in DevTools)
- [ ] ✅ Switch tabs → return to profile → loads instantly (from cache)
- [ ] ✅ Send message → optimistic update (appears before server confirms)
- [ ] ✅ Real-time message → cache invalidated → refetches
- [ ] ✅ Network tab: Fewer database queries (deduplication working)
- [ ] 🧪 Throttle to Slow 3G → cached data appears instantly
- [ ] 🧪 Disconnect internet → cached data still visible
- [ ] 🧪 Reconnect → refetches fresh data
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of React Query DevTools
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of Network tab (showing reduced queries)
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Caching must reduce queries without stale data
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Implement intelligent caching with React Query"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All data fetching uses React Query
- ✅ Reduced database queries (>50% reduction)

### PHASE 1.75: PRODUCTION HARDENING & SECURITY (Parallel with Phase 1.5 or immediately after)

**Purpose:** Make the app production-ready with security, scalability, and data protection
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks (can run parallel with Phase 1.5 modules)
**Philosophy:** Security first, scale-ready, user-friendly errors

**Why This Matters:**
Phase 1.5 makes code maintainable. Phase 1.75 makes the app secure and scalable. Together, they create a bulletproof foundation for 10,000+ users.

**Modules:**
1. **Security Hardening** (Week 1) - RLS, rate limiting, content moderation
2. **Performance & Scalability** (Week 2) - Indexes, query limits, image optimization
3. **Data Protection** (Week 3) - Soft deletes, backups, monitoring

---

#### Module 1: Security Hardening (Week 1)

**Critical security vulnerabilities that must be fixed before production launch.**

---

##### Day 1-2: Row Level Security (RLS)

**Current State:**
- RLS disabled or not configured
- Any authenticated user can access/modify any data
- Major security vulnerability

**Target:**
- RLS enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper policies for shared data (groups, messages)

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Enable RLS on All Tables**
```sql

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE testimonies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE friendships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE groups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE group_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE group_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

      WHERE gm.group_id = group_members.group_id
      AND gm.user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text)
    )
  );

-- Leaders can add members
CREATE POLICY "Leaders can add members"
  ON group_members FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (

```

**Step 3: Test RLS Policies**
- [ ] Create test migration file
- [ ] Apply migration to staging database
- [ ] Test each policy with different user scenarios
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access is blocked

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - RLS (60 min):**
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot read User B's private messages
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot update User B's profile
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot delete User B's testimony
- [ ] ✅ User A can view User B's public testimony
- [ ] ✅ User A can send message to User B
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot view groups they're not in
- [ ] ✅ User A cannot view group messages for groups they're not in
- [ ] ✅ Group leader can add members
- [ ] ✅ Group member cannot add other members
- [ ] 🧪 Try accessing data via browser DevTools (should fail)
- [ ] 🧪 Test with multiple user sessions simultaneously
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of blocked unauthorized access
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must pass all tests before production
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Enable Row Level Security with comprehensive policies"

##### Day 3-4: Rate Limiting

**Current State:**
- No rate limiting
- Users can spam actions infinitely
- Vulnerable to abuse and cost bombs

**Target:**
- Generous rate limits that don't affect normal users
- Prevents spam and abuse
- User-friendly error messages

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Database-Level Rate Limiting (RLS Policies)**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_rate_limiting.sql

-- Rate limit: Max 100 messages per hour
CREATE POLICY "Rate limit messages"
  ON messages FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    (
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages
      WHERE sender_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text)
      AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    ) < 100
  );

-- Rate limit: Max 20 friend requests per hour
CREATE POLICY "Rate limit friend requests"
  ON friendships FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    (
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM friendships
      WHERE requested_by = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text)
      AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    ) < 20
  );

-- Rate limit: Max 5 testimony updates per hour
CREATE POLICY "Rate limit testimony updates"
  ON testimonies FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    (
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM testimonies
      WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text)
      AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    ) < 5
  );

-- Rate limit: Max 10 profile updates per hour
CREATE POLICY "Rate limit profile updates"
  ON users FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    (
      SELECT updated_at FROM users
      WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text
    ) < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 minutes' -- ~10 per hour
    OR
    (
      SELECT updated_at FROM users
      WHERE clerk_user_id = auth.uid()::text
    ) IS NULL
  );
```

**Step 2: Client-Side Rate Limit Tracking**
```typescript
// src/lib/utils/rate-limiter.ts

interface RateLimit {
  count: number;
  resetAt: number;
}

const limits = new Map<string, RateLimit>();

export const checkRateLimit = (
  action: string,
  maxCalls: number,
  windowMs: number
): { allowed: boolean; retryAfter?: number } => {
  const key = action;
  const now = Date.now();
  const limit = limits.get(key);

  // Reset if window expired
  if (!limit || now > limit.resetAt) {
    limits.set(key, { count: 1, resetAt: now + windowMs });
    return { allowed: true };
  }

  // Check if limit exceeded
  if (limit.count >= maxCalls) {
    const retryAfter = Math.ceil((limit.resetAt - now) / 1000);
    return { allowed: false, retryAfter };
  }

  // Increment count
  limit.count++;
  return { allowed: true };
};

// Usage in components
import { checkRateLimit } from '../lib/utils/rate-limiter';

const handleSendMessage = async () => {
  const rateCheck = checkRateLimit('send-message', 100, 60 * 60 * 1000); // 100 per hour

  if (!rateCheck.allowed) {
    toast.error(`Please wait ${rateCheck.retryAfter} seconds before sending more messages`);
    return;
  }

  await sendMessage(content);
};
```

**Step 3: User-Friendly UI for Rate Limits**
```tsx
// src/components/RateLimitMessage.tsx
export const RateLimitMessage: React.FC<{ retryAfter: number }> = ({ retryAfter }) => {
  const [secondsLeft, setSecondsLeft] = useState(retryAfter);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      setSecondsLeft(prev => Math.max(0, prev - 1));
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
        <span className="text-2xl">⏱️</span>
        <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-800">Slow down there!</p>
      </div>
      <p className="text-yellow-700 mb-3">
        You can send more messages in {secondsLeft} seconds.
        Take a breather and we'll be ready when you are! 😊
      </p>
      <div className="w-full bg-yellow-200 rounded-full h-2">
        <div
          className="bg-yellow-500 h-2 rounded-full transition-all duration-1000"
          style={{ width: `${(secondsLeft / retryAfter) * 100}%` }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - RATE LIMITING (30 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Send 100 messages in 5 minutes → all succeed
- [ ] ✅ Try to send 101st message → shows friendly error
- [ ] ✅ Wait 1 hour → can send messages again
- [ ] ✅ Rapid-click "Send Friend Request" 25 times → first 20 succeed, rest blocked
- [ ] ✅ Rate limit message shows countdown timer
- [ ] ✅ Normal usage (5-10 messages/hour) unaffected
- [ ] 🧪 Test with rapid clicking (button mashing)
- [ ] 🧪 Test countdown timer accuracy
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of rate limit UI
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Limits must be generous enough for real users
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Add rate limiting with user-friendly error messages"

---

##### Day 5-7: Content Moderation

**Current State:**
- No spam/abuse filtering
- Users can post anything
- Vulnerable to spam, scams, harassment

**Target:**
- Basic automated filtering for obvious spam/abuse
- User reporting system
- Manual review queue
- Permissive filters (avoid false positives)

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Create Basic Content Filter**
```typescript
// src/lib/moderation/content-filter.ts

interface ModerationResult {
  allowed: boolean;
  reason?: string;
  flagged?: boolean;
  confidence?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

// Very conservative - only block obvious spam
const SPAM_PATTERNS = [
  /buy.{0,15}viagra/i,
  /click here.{0,30}https?:\/\//i,
  /\$\$\$+/,  // Multiple dollar signs
  /win \$?\d+,?\d* (dollars?|USD)/i,
  /earn money (fast|quick|easy)/i,
];

// Suspicious patterns (flag for review, don't block)
const SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS = [
  /https?:\/\/[^\s]{3,}/gi,  // URLs
  /\b\d{10,}\b/,  // Long numbers (phone, crypto wallet)
];

// Words allowed in faith context
const FAITH_CONTEXT_ALLOWED = [
  'damn', 'hell', 'crap', // Authentic expressions
];

export const moderateContent = (text: string): ModerationResult => {
  // Check for spam patterns
  for (const pattern of SPAM_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.test(text)) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        reason: 'This content appears to be spam. If you believe this is a mistake, please contact support.',
        confidence: 'high'
      };
    }
  }

  // Check for link spam (3+ links is suspicious)
  const linkMatches = text.match(/https?:\/\//gi);
  if (linkMatches && linkMatches.length > 3) {
    return {
      allowed: false,
      reason: 'Too many links in one message. Please limit links to 3 or fewer.',
      confidence: 'medium'
    };
  }

  // Check for all caps (likely spam, but flag instead of block)
  const wordsInCaps = text.match(/\b[A-Z]{4,}\b/g);
  if (wordsInCaps && wordsInCaps.length > 5) {
    return {
      allowed: true,
      flagged: true,
      confidence: 'low'
    };
  }

  // Check for suspicious patterns (flag for review)
  for (const pattern of SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.test(text)) {
      return {
        allowed: true,
        flagged: true,
        confidence: 'low'
      };
    }
  }

  return { allowed: true };
};
```

**Step 2: Add Flagged Content Table**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_flagged_content.sql

CREATE TABLE flagged_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (content_type IN ('testimony', 'message', 'group_message', 'profile')),
  content_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  reason TEXT,
  confidence TEXT CHECK (confidence IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  reviewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  action_taken TEXT CHECK (action_taken IN ('approved', 'removed', 'warned')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_flagged_content_reviewed ON flagged_content(reviewed) WHERE reviewed = false;
CREATE INDEX idx_flagged_content_confidence ON flagged_content(confidence);
```

**Step 3: Integrate into Components**
```typescript
// src/components/MessagesTab.tsx
import { moderateContent } from '../lib/moderation/content-filter';

const handleSendMessage = async () => {
  // Moderate content before sending
  const moderation = moderateContent(messageContent);

  if (!moderation.allowed) {
    toast.error(moderation.reason);
    return;
  }

  // Send message
  await sendMessage(messageContent);

  // If flagged, log for review
  if (moderation.flagged) {
    await supabase.from('flagged_content').insert({
      content_type: 'message',
      content_id: messageId,
      user_id: currentUserId,
      reason: 'Automated flag',
      confidence: moderation.confidence
    });
  }
};
```

**Step 4: User Reporting System**
```typescript
// src/components/ReportButton.tsx
export const ReportButton: React.FC<{
  contentType: string;
  contentId: string;
  userId: string;
}> = ({ contentType, contentId, userId }) => {
  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false);
  const [reason, setReason] = useState('');

  const handleReport = async () => {
    await supabase.from('reports').insert({
      content_type: contentType,
      content_id: contentId,
      reported_user_id: userId,
      reported_by: currentUserId,
      reason,
      created_at: new Date()
    });

    toast.success('Report submitted. Thank you for keeping our community safe.');
    setShowDialog(false);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShowDialog(true)} className="text-red-500">
        🚩 Report
      </button>

      {showDialog && (
        <Dialog>
          <h3>Report Content</h3>
          <p>Help us understand what's wrong with this content:</p>
          <select value={reason} onChange={(e) => setReason(e.target.value)}>
            <option value="">Select a reason...</option>
            <option value="spam">Spam or scam</option>
            <option value="harassment">Harassment or bullying</option>
            <option value="inappropriate">Inappropriate content</option>
            <option value="false_info">False information</option>
            <option value="other">Other</option>
          </select>
          <button onClick={handleReport}>Submit Report</button>
        </Dialog>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - CONTENT MODERATION (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Post "Buy cheap Viagra!" → blocked with clear error
- [ ] ✅ Post with 5 links → blocked
- [ ] ✅ Post with 1-2 links → allowed
- [ ] ✅ Post "I was damn angry at God" → allowed (faith context)
- [ ] ✅ Post in ALL CAPS → flagged but allowed

---

#### Module 2: Performance & Scalability (Week 2)

**Optimizations to handle 10,000+ users without slowdowns or crashes.**

---

##### Day 1-2: Database Indexes

**Current State:**
- Minimal indexes beyond primary keys
- Slow queries on large datasets
- Poor performance at scale

**Target:**
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Fast queries even with 100,000+ users
- Optimized for common access patterns

**Implementation:**

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_performance_indexes.sql

-- USERS TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_users_clerk_user_id ON users(clerk_user_id);  -- Already exists as unique
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);  -- Already exists as unique
CREATE INDEX idx_users_last_seen ON users(last_seen DESC) WHERE last_seen IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_is_online ON users(is_online) WHERE is_online = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_location_point ON users USING GIST(location_point) WHERE location_point IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_has_testimony ON users(has_testimony) WHERE has_testimony = true;

-- TESTIMONIES TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_user_id ON testimonies(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_is_public ON testimonies(is_public) WHERE is_public = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_created_at ON testimonies(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_view_count ON testimonies(view_count DESC) WHERE is_public = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_like_count ON testimonies(like_count DESC) WHERE is_public = true;

-- MESSAGES TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_sender_id ON messages(sender_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_recipient_id ON messages(recipient_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation ON messages(sender_id, recipient_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_unread ON messages(recipient_id, is_read) WHERE is_read = false;

-- FRIENDSHIPS TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_friendships_user_id_1 ON friendships(user_id_1, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_friendships_user_id_2 ON friendships(user_id_2, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_friendships_status ON friendships(status, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_friendships_pending ON friendships(user_id_2) WHERE status = 'pending';

-- GROUPS TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_groups_created_by ON groups(created_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_groups_created_at ON groups(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_groups_is_private ON groups(is_private);

-- GROUP_MEMBERS TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_group_members_group_id ON group_members(group_id, joined_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_group_members_user_id ON group_members(user_id, joined_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_group_members_role ON group_members(group_id, role);

-- GROUP_MESSAGES TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_group_messages_group_id ON group_messages(group_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_group_messages_sender_id ON group_messages(sender_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_group_messages_pinned ON group_messages(group_id, is_pinned) WHERE is_pinned = true;

-- NOTIFICATIONS TABLE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_id ON notifications(user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_unread ON notifications(user_id, is_read) WHERE is_read = false;
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_type ON notifications(user_id, type, created_at DESC);

-- Composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_unread ON messages(sender_id, recipient_id, is_read, created_at DESC);
```

**Performance Testing:**
```sql
-- Test query performance before/after indexes

-- Query 1: Load user conversations (MessagesTab)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT DISTINCT ON (LEAST(sender_id, recipient_id), GREATEST(sender_id, recipient_id))
  *
FROM messages
WHERE sender_id = 'user-id' OR recipient_id = 'user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Query 2: Find nearby users (NearbyTab)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE location_point IS NOT NULL
AND ST_DWithin(
  location_point,
  ST_MakePoint(-122.4194, 37.7749)::geography,
  40233.6  -- 25 miles in meters
)
ORDER BY last_seen DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Query 3: Load group messages
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM group_messages
WHERE group_id = 'group-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- All queries should show "Index Scan" not "Seq Scan"
-- Execution time should be < 50ms even with 100,000 rows
```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - INDEXES (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on all common queries
- [ ] ✅ Verify all queries use indexes (no Seq Scan)
- [ ] ✅ Query times < 50ms for common operations
- [ ] ✅ Test with large dataset (seed 10,000+ test users)
- [ ] ✅ MessagesTab loads in < 200ms
- [ ] ✅ NearbyTab loads in < 300ms
- [ ] ✅ GroupsTab loads in < 200ms
- [ ] 🧪 Benchmark before/after index creation
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of EXPLAIN ANALYZE results
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must improve query performance significantly
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Add comprehensive database indexes for performance"

##### Day 3-4: Image Upload Validation & Optimization

**Current State:**
- No size/type validation
- No image optimization
- Users can upload huge files

**Target:**
- Max 8MB file size
- Only image types allowed
- Auto-compression and optimization
- Fast uploads and loads

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Client-Side Validation**
```typescript
// src/lib/upload/image-validator.ts

export interface ValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

export const validateImage = async (file: File): Promise<ValidationResult> => {
  // Check file size (max 8MB)
  const MAX_SIZE = 8 * 1024 * 1024; // 8MB
  if (file.size > MAX_SIZE) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: 'Image must be less than 8MB. Please choose a smaller file or compress it.'
    };
  }

  // Check file type
  const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif'];
  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: 'Only JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF images are allowed.'
    };
  }

  // Check image dimensions
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => {
      const MAX_DIMENSION = 4000;
      if (img.width > MAX_DIMENSION || img.height > MAX_DIMENSION) {
        resolve({
          valid: false,
          error: `Image dimensions too large. Maximum ${MAX_DIMENSION}x${MAX_DIMENSION}px.`
        });
      } else {
        resolve({ valid: true });
      }
      URL.revokeObjectURL(img.src);
    };
    img.onerror = () => {
      resolve({
        valid: false,
        error: 'Invalid image file. Please try a different image.'
      });
    };
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  });
};
```

**Step 2: Image Optimization**
```typescript
// src/lib/upload/image-optimizer.ts
import imageCompression from 'browser-image-compression';

export const optimizeImage = async (file: File): Promise<File> => {
  // Compression options
  const options = {
    maxSizeMB: 0.8,  // Target 800KB
    maxWidthOrHeight: 1920,  // Max dimension
    useWebWorker: true,
    fileType: 'image/webp',  // Convert to WebP for better compression
  };

  try {
    const compressedFile = await imageCompression(file, options);
    return compressedFile;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Image compression failed:', error);
    // Return original if compression fails
    return file;
  }
};
```

**Step 3: Upload with Validation**
```typescript
// src/lib/upload/image-uploader.ts
import { validateImage } from './image-validator';
import { optimizeImage } from './image-optimizer';

export const uploadImage = async (
  file: File,
  type: 'profile' | 'group' | 'message'
): Promise<{ url: string; error?: string }> => {
  // Validate
  const validation = await validateImage(file);
  if (!validation.valid) {
    return { url: '', error: validation.error };
  }

  // Optimize
  const optimizedFile = await optimizeImage(file);

  // Upload to Cloudinary (or Supabase Storage)
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', optimizedFile);
  formData.append('upload_preset', import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRESET);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}/image/upload`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      }
    );

    const data = await response.json();
    return { url: data.secure_url };
  } catch (error) {
    return { url: '', error: 'Upload failed. Please try again.' };
  }
};
```

**Step 4: UI Integration**
```tsx
// src/components/ImageUpload.tsx
export const ImageUpload: React.FC<{ onUpload: (url: string) => void }> = ({ onUpload }) => {
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>();

  const handleFileSelect = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    setError(undefined);
    setUploading(true);

    const result = await uploadImage(file, 'profile');

    if (result.error) {
      setError(result.error);
    } else {
      onUpload(result.url);
    }

    setUploading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label className="cursor-pointer bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
        {uploading ? 'Uploading...' : 'Upload Image'}
        <input
          type="file"
          accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif"
          onChange={handleFileSelect}
          disabled={uploading}
          className="hidden"
        />
      </label>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Max 8MB • JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF
      </p>
      {error && (
        <p className="text-red-500 mt-2">{error}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**🧪 TESTING CHECKPOINT - IMAGE UPLOAD (45 min):**
- [ ] ✅ Upload 5MB JPEG → succeeds, compressed to ~600KB
- [ ] ✅ Upload 10MB PNG → error: "Image must be less than 8MB"
- [ ] ✅ Upload PDF file → error: "Only JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF allowed"
- [ ] ✅ Upload 8000x6000px image → error: "Dimensions too large"
- [ ] ✅ Upload valid 2MB image → succeeds in < 5 seconds
- [ ] ✅ Optimized images still look good (no visible quality loss)
- [ ] ✅ Upload shows progress/loading state
- [ ] ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] 🧪 Test with various image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- [ ] 🧪 Test with very small images (10KB) - should still work
- [ ] 🧪 Test upload cancellation
- [ ] 📸 Screenshot of validation error messages
- [ ] 📸 Before/after file sizes (e.g., 5MB → 600KB)
- [ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must not degrade image quality noticeably
- [ ] ✅ Commit changes: "Add image validation and optimization (max 8MB)"

##### Day 5-6: Geospatial Query Limits & Soft Deletes

**Part A: Geospatial Query Limits**

**Current State:**
```sql
-- Returns ALL users within radius (could be 50,000+)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE ST_DWithin(...)
```

**Target:**
```sql
-- Returns max 100 users, with pagination
SELECT * FROM users WHERE ST_DWithin(...) LIMIT 100 OFFSET 0
```

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_update_nearby_users_function.sql

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION find_nearby_users(
  user_lat DECIMAL,
  user_lng DECIMAL,
  radius_miles INTEGER DEFAULT 25,

  result_offset INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id UUID,
  username TEXT,
  display_name TEXT,
  avatar_emoji TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  location_city TEXT,
  is_online BOOLEAN,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP,
  has_testimony BOOLEAN,
  distance_miles DECIMAL
) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    u.id,
    u.username,
    u.display_name,
    u.avatar_emoji,
    u.avatar_url,
    u.bio,
    u.location_city,
    u.is_online,
    u.last_seen,
    u.has_testimony,
    ROUND(
      ST_Distance(
        u.location_point,
        ST_MakePoint(user_lng, user_lat)::geography
      ) / 1609.34,
      1
    ) AS distance_miles
  FROM users u
  WHERE u.location_point IS NOT NULL
  AND ST_DWithin(
    u.location_point,
    ST_MakePoint(user_lng, user_lat)::geography,
    radius_miles * 1609.34
  )
  ORDER BY u.last_seen DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT result_limit
  OFFSET result_offset;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
// src/components/NearbyTab.tsx
const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
const [offset, setOffset] = useState(0);

const loadNearbyUsers = async (loadMore = false) => {
  const currentOffset = loadMore ? offset : 0;

  const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('find_nearby_users', {
    user_lat: myLocation.lat,
    user_lng: myLocation.lng,
    radius_miles: 25,
    result_limit: 100,
    result_offset: currentOffset
  });

  if (data) {
    setUsers(loadMore ? [...users, ...data] : data);
    setHasMore(data.length === 100); // If got full 100, there might be more
    setOffset(currentOffset + 100);
  }
};

// In UI
{hasMore && (
  <button onClick={() => loadNearbyUsers(true)}>
    Load More Believers
  </button>
)}
```

**Part B: Soft Deletes**

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_soft_deletes.sql

-- Add deleted_at column to all tables
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE testimonies ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE groups ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE group_messages ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Create indexes for soft delete queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_deleted ON users(deleted_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_testimonies_deleted ON testimonies(deleted_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_deleted ON messages(deleted_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Update RLS policies to exclude deleted items
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON users;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles"
  ON users FOR SELECT
  USING (deleted_at IS NULL);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view public testimonies" ON testimonies;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public testimonies"
  ON testimonies FOR SELECT
  USING (is_public = true AND deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Add undo delete functionality
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION undo_delete_testimony(testimony_id UUID)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE testimonies
  SET deleted_at = NULL
  WHERE id = testimony_id
  AND deleted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
// src/lib/database/repositories/testimonies.repository.ts

export const deleteTestimony = async (testimonyId: string): Promise<void> => {
  // Soft delete
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('testimonies')
    .update({ deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    .eq('id', testimonyId);

  if (error) throw error;

  // Show undo toast
  toast((t) => (
    <div className="flex gap-3 items-center">
      <span>Testimony deleted</span>
      <button
        onClick={() => undoDeleteTestimony(testimonyId, t.id)}
        className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded"
      >
        Undo
      </button>
    </div>
  ), { duration: 10000 });
};

export const undoDeleteTestimony = async (testimonyId: string, toastId: string): Promise<void> => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('testimonies')
    .update({ deleted_at: null })
    .eq('id', testimonyId);

  if (!error) {
    toast.success('Testimony restored!');
    toast.dismiss(toastId);
  }
};
```
